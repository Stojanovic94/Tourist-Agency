## Travel Agency

This project features a travel booking form that allows users to enter various details about their trip and select additional options. The page has a modern and user-friendly design, with particular attention to the layout and styling of the web form elements.

### Key Features:
- **Responsive and Modern Design**: The page has a clean, attractive design with well-organized elements, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Destination Slideshow**: A simple slideshow showcasing images of attractive travel destinations is displayed just below the header. The header contains the logo and the name of the agency, which can be customized creatively.
- **Form Validation**: JavaScript is used to validate the form before submission. It ensures that all fields are correctly filled out (e.g., no invalid dates, correct phone number format, and name not left empty). 
- **Total Price Calculation**: Once the form is completed, clicking the "OK" button calculates the total price of the trip, based on factors like the number of nights, number of travelers, selected additional options, and accommodation type. The total price is displayed on the page or shown via an alert.
- **Reset Function**: The "Reset" button clears all fields and resets the form.
- **Destination List**: A dropdown list contains at least five destinations to choose from, with each destination having its own base price per night.
- **Additional Options**: Users can select additional options that may affect the final price of the trip.
- **Navigation Menu**: A vertical navigation menu is included on the page, providing links to other pages of the site (though not required to be fully styled for this exercise).
- **Slideshow Content**: The slideshow includes at least five images that correspond to the destinations listed in the form.
